# Craps-Simulator-with-Exception-and-JUnit-test
This Craps Simulator I built my own exception classes to handle possible error input that users enter, such as invalid amount of money, bet, etc. Also I built my testing case using JUnit, to handle normal cases, error cases, and boundary cases. To run the code, you can go to the lab3.py to run the code.
